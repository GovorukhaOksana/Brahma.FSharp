This project for modeling architecture TTA.

Project structure

For work with calculator I use the matrix representation. 
for description TTA I use the array of dictionaries with value. Number of dictionares is number of functions, which we want 
to use on our calculator, it represented by collumns. Key of dictionary is our row.  
Values of dictionaries descripted in class "Cell". This class is generic and contain some operation and some argument.
For computing expressions we have 3 Base operations: Set((x, y), argument), Move((fromX, fromY), (toX, toY)), Mvc((x, y) argument).
